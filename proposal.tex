\section{Introduction to wood structure and formation}
As trees grow they produce wood in order to become taller and wider. Becoming
taller and increasing canopy size is an effective way to out compete the other
trees and plants for light. With increasing height and width comes increasing
weight, wind drag and internal pressures (for water transport), which requires
either enough redundant strength in the existing structure (such as young monocotyledons) or
for the tree to strengthen its structure as it increases its size. In
dicotyledons and gymnosperms this occurs in two ways, apical and cambial growth
on branches, roots and the stem(s).

Softwoods have a simpler micro structure than hardwoods, consisting mainly of
axially elongated pointed cells named tracheids which serve as both mechanical
support structures and water conduits. Although varying with species, softwoods
may also contain radially orientated tracheids, radially or axially orientated
parenchyma cells and other cell types. Tracheids are the dominant form of cells
within the stems and branches.

Hardwoods contain a more complex micro structure with a number
of different cell types. Fibres provide structural support as their primary
function, while similar to softwood tracheids they differ in some key aspects,
being shorter in the longitudinal direction, more rounded in the transverse
outline, tend to have smaller lumens and have little role in sap ascent. However
the ends do taper to points as in softwood tracheids. Libriform fibres tend to
be longer than fibre trachiads, have thicker walls and are solely for support.
Fibre trachiads function in both conduction and support, as in softwoods,
however their appearance in wood with vessels suggests that they function
primarily for support, and perhaps are an intermediate evolutionary feature
between the softwood trachiad and the libriform fibre. Septate fibres devide
their cell lumens into chambers without crossing the primary cell wall. Septate
fibres are produced in the late stages of division just prior to the death of
the cytoplasm, and appear to resemble axial parenchyma cells, and have been
hypothesised to store starches, oils and resins.

Vessels are the main conduits for sap ascent. Vessels are comprised of multiple
vessel elements being joined at the ends to form long conduits, which can extend short
distances (often less than 200mm) or can be as long as the height of the tree.
These elements are connected through pores or perforations in perforation
plates at the end walls of the cells. The arrangement of vessels into groups is
species dependent and usually described as ring porous (the vessels congregate in early wood)
or diffuse porous (vessels are distributed throughout both early and late wood).

Further cell types also exist, such as vasicentric tracheids which have profuse
side wall pitting exhibiting deformation from the expansion of the surrounding
vessels. Axial parenchyma cells are generally abundant and tend to exist in
vertical files and are expected to play a role in the development of heartwood.

Rays are formed from radially orientated cells often trachieds or parenchyma.

\subsection{Basic cell division}
Dicotyledons and gymnosperms grow in two main ways, upward apical growth and
outward cambial growth.

Note monocotyledons (for example palms) do not produce secondary growth and instead diameter
forms as part of primary growth.

As the cambium is forming fusiform and ray initials are created.
(how are the initials created)
Fusiform initials are short radially and tangetialy with tapered
ends. From the cambial initials cells to the inside create the vertical elements
of xylem (tracheids, vessels, fibers, parenchyma, etc.), while cells outside become phloem.
Ray initials produce horizontal elements (rays).

Cambial cells divide in two ways, periclainal and anticlinal.
Periclainal cell division occurs to the inner and outer of the cambial layers.
As the cell division to the inside occurs the volume of secondary xylem that is being
formed increases the tangential stress on vascular cambium resulting in an
extention of the cambial circumference. Although over time many plants show an
increase in the longitudinal and tangential dimensions of the cambial initials it is
likely that this expansion is mainly facilitated by anticlinal division followed
by the expansion of the daughter cells next to the pedant.

\section{Introduction to growth stresses}

ref to above for cell elongation and death

early work in 20s and related models/theories

lignin swelling

cellulose contraction

hemicelluose theories

yamamotos recent model

issues with current understanding


\subsection{Why growth stresses exist}

hardwoods v softwoods

speculation from various authors

mechanical hypotheses

\subsection{Intro to the issues growth stresses cause }

for harvesting

within mills

\section{Theoretical and experimental understanding of growth stresses}

\subsection{Background of breading}

field techniques

laboratory techniques

stat techniques

mention tradeoff with durability etc

\subsubsection{Beading work in this thesis}
What we actually have:

Harewood trial:
dec 2014 has bosistoana and argophloia copiced from old planting that mon has GS
data from.
New Harewood trial, 2016 harvest, will have a number of species potential to
copice bos again if needed.

Woodvile, 2016/2017 harvest will have Bosistoana, argophloia and possibly globoidea.
May or may not be the same families as the various drylands trials.

NOTE family means same mother, not same father.
If collected at different times even from the same tree variability exists due
to possibly of different set of fathers. Also some self propagate, but we don't
know which ones or what proportion, so ignore this.

Progeny trials are alpha latauses, harewood is a standard randomised individual
trial.

normal breading stats?

\subsection{Background of chemistry work}

lignin swelling

cellulose contraction

what has been done in the past?


\subsubsection{Chemistry work in this thesis}

Do all of the DFI species have a G-layer?
Maybe include some Nitens tests if they don't.
check MFA and SD for S\_2 in tension, normal and compression/opposite wood
Get cellulose lignin and hemicellulose(s) contests for tension normal and
compression/opposite wood Split hemicelluloses where possible, eg xyloglucan
etc.
Torsion tests on individual cells, again for tension, normal and compression. Maybe remove G-Layer
in tension wood and compare to normal and compression wood of similar MFA and compounds etc.

Could we somehow measure growth stress release on a single cell?
Ideally, grow disordered cells invitro, and separate them from the parent cell
as soon as possible, then record when in their formation they undergo what
dimension changes. Is there some non-destructive test to check what is going on in the cell? or if we have multiple cells in the same conditions maybe we can destructivly test some during the growth phase, under the assumption they are all growing at the same time.
OR
remove the cambial layer leaving top and bottom of cell attached to the stem on a large sample,
then somehow remove the connection to the cells behind it, then release the top and measure the contraction.


\subsection{Background of modeling}

yammamotos most resent attempt

possible different methods > FEM, DEM, molecular dynamics, gemomentry of stem
and cells

\subsubsection{Modeling in this thesis}
cells as partials in relaxed state

apply body force, ie the growth stress field

get original/non cut stick back

take take groups of repressive cells and use composite theory and position dependent body force
(growth strain field) from the sub domain above

introduce time dependence to see how the stress field develops during
maturation, composite scale still

take individual cells at macromolecular level and try to produce stress field
above during a time dependent maturation function

Molecular dynamics simulations to work out the molecular mechanisms developing the growth stresses

Using the MD sims paramertorize a cell model

Using the cell model develop a time dependent field function

from the field function create representative cell blocks

put the cell blocks together into a stick

cut the stick > do we get out what we put it?

\section{Intentions}
