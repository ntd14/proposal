use origin_proposal rather than default git use of origin to push to git

to update:
 	git add . or git add file_name
then to commit to local repo:
	git commit -m "some message is needed"
to send to github:
	git push -u origin_proposal master

If origin_exp_paper is undefined use:
	git remote add origin_proposal https://github.com/ntd14/proposal.git

In eclipse go to git tab then right click proposal click commit then click push to upstream
Remember to save changes first

to convert to .doc for clemens:
 	mk4ht mzlatex ./exp_paper.tex "html, mathtools"
produces an xml and a css file. Take the xml file and delete the first line, this is the declaration that it is a xml not html
change the xml extension to .doc and copy (along with the .css file) to a computer with word
open in word, may have to open word then then open the file. if there is some dtd error then the xml declaration may still be there
save as a word 2010 or whatever file.
